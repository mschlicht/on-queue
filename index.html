  <h1>Privacy Policy for On-Queue</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 1/5/2025</p>
  <p>On-Queue respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is collected, stored, and shared when you use the app. By using On-Queue, you agree to the practices outlined here.</p>
  
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>1.1 Local Data Storage</h3>
  <p>On-Queue stores your data, such as queues, ratings, and reviews, locally on your device using <strong>Core Data</strong>.</p>
  
  <h3>1.2 iCloud Sync and CloudKit</h3>
  <p>If iCloud is enabled on your device, your data is automatically synced with your iCloud account using <strong>CloudKit</strong>. This allows you to access your data across all devices linked to your Apple ID.</p>
  
  <h3>1.3 CloudKit Share</h3>
  <p>On-Queue uses <strong>CloudKit Share</strong> to enable collaborative features. When you choose to share a queue with others:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The shared data is securely hosted in your iCloud account.</li>
    <li>Only users you explicitly invite will have access to the shared data.</li>
    <li>Shared data is synced through Apple’s iCloud infrastructure.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>1.4 No Account Creation</h3>
  <p>On-Queue does not require you to create an account. All data is managed through your iCloud account, ensuring your privacy and control.</p>
  
  <h2>2. How Your Information is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> To save and manage your queues, ratings, and reviews on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> To back up your data and make it accessible across your devices using your iCloud account.</li>
    <li><strong>CloudKit Share:</strong> To allow you to share and collaborate on queues with others securely.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>3. Data Sharing and Security</h2>
  <h3>3.1 Data Sharing</h3>
  <p>Data is only shared when you explicitly use the CloudKit Share feature to invite others to view or collaborate on your queues. Shared data is hosted within Apple’s iCloud infrastructure and is accessible only to users you authorize.</p>
  
  <h3>3.2 Data Security</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Stored securely on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>iCloud Data:</strong> Encrypted in transit and at rest using Apple’s iCloud services.</li>
    <li><strong>Shared Data:</strong> Only accessible by the users you invite. On-Queue does not have access to any of your data.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <h3>4.1 Local Control</h3>
  <p>All data stored locally on your device can be deleted by uninstalling the app.</p>
  
  <h3>4.2 iCloud Settings</h3>
  <p>You can manage iCloud sync and sharing settings through your device’s iCloud settings. Disabling iCloud for On-Queue will stop data syncing but will not affect locally stored data.</p>
  
  <h3>4.3 Sharing Control</h3>
  <p>You can stop sharing a queue at any time through the app. When sharing is revoked, invited users will no longer have access to the shared data.</p>
  
  <h2>5. No Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>On-Queue does not use third-party services for data collection, analytics, or advertising. All data handling is performed through Apple’s Core Data and CloudKit, adhering to Apple’s strict privacy standards.</p>
  <p>For more information, refer to Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as needed to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Updates will be communicated via the app.</p>
